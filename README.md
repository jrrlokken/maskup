# Mask Up! ðŸ˜·
## A Keystone.js and React face mask marketplace

Buy and sell face masks to protect you and others during the pandemic :)  
Sign up for an account, sell your own products, or 'buy' one of the available masks.  
The payment API is Stripe, and is in test mode.  There are lots of test cards for you to use [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).
